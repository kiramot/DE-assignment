Explanation of the AWS Lambda Integration
AWS S3: Used for storing transaction and product reference data.
AWS Lambda: Handles the REST API requests and processes data.
API Gateway: Exposes the Lambda functions as RESTful endpoints.
Pandas: Used for data manipulation within Lambda functions.
Concurrency and Scalability: AWS Lambda scales automatically with the number of requests.

Requirements Breakdown
Assignment Environment:

Data Handling: The solution uses AWS S3 to simulate real-time incoming data by storing transaction files and product reference data.
In-memory Application: The Lambda functions load data into memory upon each invocation, meeting the requirement that no persistent storage is needed.
Real-time Processing: The application processes incoming transaction data every 5 minutes (simulated by S3 object uploads) and refreshes its in-memory state on each invocation.
REST API Functionalities:

GET /transaction/{transaction_id}: Fetches and returns the transaction details by ID, including the product name and transaction details.
GET /transactionSummaryByProducts/{last_n_days}: Summarizes transaction amounts by product names for the last N days.
GET /transactionSummaryByManufacturingCity/{last_n_days}: Summarizes transaction amounts by manufacturing city for the last N days.
Sample Data Format:

Transaction Data: Handled by loading CSV files from S3 and processing them with pandas.
Product Reference Data: Loaded from a static CSV file in S3 and merged with transaction data as needed.
Evaluation Criteria:

Completeness: All specified API endpoints are implemented.
Code Quality: The code is modular, making use of pandas for data manipulation and boto3 for S3 interactions. Each Lambda function handles a specific endpoint.
Design: The use of AWS Lambda ensures scalability, with functions triggered by API Gateway and S3 events.
Concurrency: AWS Lambda inherently supports concurrent execution, ensuring that multiple requests can be handled simultaneously without blocking.
Scalability: AWS Lambda and API Gateway are designed to scale automatically with the number of requests.
Detailed Steps Revisited
Step 1: Set Up AWS Environment
Create an AWS account and IAM roles.
Create S3 buckets for transaction data and product reference data.
Step 2: Create S3 Buckets
Create two S3 buckets: transaction-data-bucket and product-reference-bucket.
Upload initial CSV files to these buckets.
Step 3: Create Lambda Layers (optional for pandas)
Create a Lambda layer for pandas if needed to reduce package size.
Step 4: Create Lambda Functions
Function: get_transaction

Fetches and returns transaction details by ID, including product name and other details.
Function: transaction_summary_by_products

Summarizes transaction amounts by product names for the last N days.
Function: transaction_summary_by_city

Summarizes transaction amounts by manufacturing city for the last N days.
Each function loads data from S3, processes it using pandas, and returns the appropriate JSON response.

Step 5: Set Up API Gateway
Create a new REST API in API Gateway.
Define resources and methods for each Lambda function.
Deploy the API.
Step 6: Test the Application
Use Postman or curl to test each endpoint, ensuring they return the correct responses.


Conclusion
This approach leverages AWS services to implement a scalable, serverless application for processing and retrieving transaction data. Each Lambda function is designed to handle specific REST API calls, with data stored in S3 and processed in real-time. The application design ensures it meets the requirements of being an in-memory application and processes data in a streaming fashion, providing an up-to-date view for the specified REST API calls.


The solution uses AWS Lambda and API Gateway to create a scalable, serverless application that processes transaction data in real-time. Each Lambda function handles a specific API request, processing data in memory and returning the required information. This design ensures that the application meets the requirements of being an in-memory application with real-time processing capabilities, capable of handling concurrent requests without blocking.
